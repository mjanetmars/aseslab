USAGE
    This voxel sprite is a stress test for the engine. It shows how slow the
    rendering becomes when an image is not culled for invisible pixels. The
    user can also use it to test the "Hide inner voxels" setting on the program.

LICENSE
    The voxel sprite is derived from the image "Mandrill" from the USC-SIPI
    Image Database, which is assumed to be in the public domain.
