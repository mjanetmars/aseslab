This is a rudimentary Python script that converts a PNG image to a VOX file,
using Ken Silverman's spec from his Slab6 project. This script is not intended
for serious use, but it is instead bundled here as a basic voxel model exporter,
to test out the basic functionality of aseSlab, and the resulting images and
models you can create with this preview suite.

Naturally, the script requires Python (3.10 or newer) to be installed for the
script to work. More importantly, for serious voxel projects in gamedev and art,
we actually recommend developing your own application for this task, or using
any of the multiple voxel art programs available online, such as MagicaVoxel,
Qubicle, or anything else actually suited for this task.

As for this Python script, this is how it's used:

  png2vox.py -i [input image] -c [tile columns] -r [tile rows]

Where the input image is a tileset of different slices of the voxel model; the
tile columns is the amount of tiles placed horizontally; and the tile rows, the
same but vertically. You can also use -o to specify the output voxel model's
filename, and -f to specify towards which direction the voxel model will be
oriented to ("front" being the default). Use "png2.vox.py -h" for more
information.

Feel free to use the Python script as the basis for your own software if needed.
But again, there's free voxel software more appropriate for this task, and you'd
be better off looking into that than using this prototype script.
